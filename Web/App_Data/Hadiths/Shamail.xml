      <text>حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو رَجَاءٍ قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، عَنْ مَالِكِ بْنِ أَنَسٍ، عَنْ رَبِيعَةَ بْنِ أَبِي عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ، عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ، أَنَّهُ سَمِعَهُ، يَقُولُ‏:‏ كَانَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم، لَيْسَ بِالطَّوِيلِ الْبَائِنِ، وَلاَ بِالْقَصِيرِ، وَلاَ بِالأَبْيَضِ الأَمْهَقِ، وَلاَ بِالآدَمِ، وَلاَ بِالْجَعْدِ الْقَطَطِ، وَلاَ بِالسَّبْطِ، بَعَثَهُ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى عَلَى رَأْسِ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً، فَأَقَامَ بِمَكَّةَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ، وَبِالْمَدِينَةِ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ، وَتَوَفَّاهُ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى عَلَى رَأْسِ سِتِّينَ سَنَةً، وَلَيْسَ فِي رَأْسِهِ وَلِحْيَتِهِ عِشْرُونَ شَعَرَةً بَيْضَاءَ‏.‏</text>

      <text>Anas (Radiallahu Anhu) reports:</text>
      <text>"Rasullullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) was neither tall nor was he short (like a dwarf... He was of medium stature). In complexion, he was neither very white like lime, nor very dark, nor brown which results in darkness (he was illuminant, more luminous than even the full-moon on the 14th night).The hair of Rasullullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) was neither very straight nor very curly (but slightly wavy). When he attained the age of forty, Allah the Almighty granted him nubuwwah (prophethood).He lived for ten years in Makkah (commentary) and in Madina for ten years. At that time there were not more than twenty white hair on his mubarak (blessed) head and beard." (This will be described in detail in the chapter on white hair of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam).</text>

      <text>It is related from Ebrahim bin Muhammad (Radiallahu anhu) who is from the sons (grand sons of Ali radiallahu anhu, that whenever Ali radiallahu anhu described the noble features of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam), he used to say:</text>
      <text>"Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) was neither very tall nor short, but of a medium stature among people. His hair was neither very curly nor very straight, but had a slight wave in it. He did not have a big body nor a round face, but his mubaarak face was slightly round (meaning he did not have a fully round face nor a fully elongated face, bur in between the two). The complexion of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) was white with redness in it. The mubaarak eyes of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) were extremely black. His eyelashes were long. The joints of the body (e.g. elbows and knees etc.) were large, likewise the portion between the two shoulders was broad and fully fleshed. There was no hair (more than normal) on his body. (Some people have profuse hair on their body. Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) did not have hair on the parts of his body, besides places like the arms and legs etc.) He had a thin line of hair running from the chest to the navel. The hands and feet of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) were fully fleshed. When he walked, he lifted his legs with vigor, as if he were descending to a low-lying place. When he addressed a person he turned his whole body towards that person. (He did not only turn his face towards the person he addressed, as this is considered impolite, and sometimes, it even denotes pride. Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) faced the person he spoke to, with his chest and body. Some scholars have translated this as, when Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) addressed someone, he completely turned his face towards that person, and did not give a side glance. This is not a suitable translation). The seal of prophethood was situated between his shoulders. He was a last of all prophets. He was the most generous and the most truthful. He was the most kind-hearted and came from a most noble family. (It means his character, family back-ground and everything else was of the best). Any person who saw him suddenly would become awe-inspired. Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) had such a great personality and dignity, that the person who saw him for the first time, because of his awe-inspiring personality, would be overcome with a feeling of profound respect. Firstly, there is a ro`b (awe) for physical beauty, with this when other Kamaalat are added what more could then be said of the ro'b (awe). Besides, the special attributes and qualities granted to Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) ro'b (awe) is also one of the special qualities granted to him). Anyone who came in close contact with him, and knew his excellent character was smitten with the love of his excellent attributes. Anyone who described his noble features can only say: "I have not seen anyone like Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) neither before nor after him."</text>

      <text>Hasan bin Ali (Radiallahu anhu) reported:</text>
      <text>"I inquired from my maternal uncle (Sayyiditina Fatimah Radiallahu anha's step brother) Hind bin Abi Haalah (Radiallahu anhu) about the noble features of the Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam). He had often described the noble features of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) in detail. I felt that I should hear from him personally, some of the noble features of Raulullah (Sallallahu alalihe wasallam), so that I could make his description a proof and testimony for myself and also memorize them, and, if possible, try to emulate and adopt them. (The age of Sayyidna Hasan (Radiallahu anhu) at the time of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam)'s death was seven years. In view of his age he did not have the opportunity to realize fully the features of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam). The uncle described the noble features by saying: "He had great qualities and attributes in him, others also held him in high esteem. His mubarak face shone like the full moon. He was slightly taller than a man of middle height, but shorter than a tall person. His mubarak head was moderately large. His mubarak hair was slightly twisted. If his hair became parted naturally in the middle he left it so, otherwise he did not habitually make an effort to part his hair in the middle. (This is a more respected translation).A question may arise that Sayyidina Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) habitually parted his hair as stated in Ahadith. The Ulama say that this was in the early periods where Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) did not make an effort to do so. According to this humble servant, the answer to this is bit difficult, because it was the principal of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) to oppose the ways of the non-believers, and agree to the ways of Ahlul Kitab, he did not part his hair in the middle. For this reason, according to some Ulama, the best translation will be that he only parted his hair in the middle if it could be easily done, and when this could not be done easily, and a comb etc. was needed to do it, then he did not part his hair in the middle. Occasionally he used to part his hair in the middle with a comb etc. When the hair of Rasulullah (Sallallalhu alaihe wasallallam) was abundant, it used to pass over his ear-lobes). Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) had a very luminous complexion (colour), and a wide forehead. He had dense and fine hair on his eye brows. Both eye brows were separate and did not meet each other in the middle. There was a vein between them that used to expand when he became angry. His nose was prominent and had a nur and lustre on it. When one first looked at him, it seemed as if he had a large nose, but looking at it carefully showed that the lustre and beauty made it look large, otherwise in itself the nose was not large."His beard was full and dense. The pupil of his eye was black. His cheeks were full and full of flesh. The mouth of Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) was moderately wide. (He did not have a small mouth). His teeth were thin and bright. The front teeth had a slight space between them. There was a thin line of hair from the chest to the navel. His neck was beautiful and thin, like the neck of a statue shaved clean, the colour of which was clear, shining and beautiful like silver. All the parts of his body were of moderate size, and fully fleshed. His body was proportionately jointed. His chest and stomach were in line, but his chest was broad and wide. The space between his shoulders was wide. The bones of his joints were strong and large (denoting strength). When he removed his clothing, his body looked bright and had a lustre (or rather those parts of the body that were not covered by his clothing were also bright and shining, compared with those parts of the body that were covered by his clothing. According to this humble servant the latter translation is more appropriate). Between the chest and navel there was a thin line of hair. Besides this line neither the chest nor the stomach had other hair on it. Both sides, the shoulders and the upper portion of the chest had hair. His forearm was long and palms were wide. The palms and both feet were fully fleshed. The fingers and toes were moderately long. The soles of his feet were a bit deep. His feet were smooth, because of their cleanliness and smoothness the water did not remain there but flowed away quickly. When he walked, he lifted his legs with vigor, leaned slightly forward and placed his feet softly on the ground. He walked at a quick pace and took rather a long step. He did not take small steps. When he walked it seemed as if he was descending to a lower place. When he looked at something he turned his whole body towards it. He always looked down. His sight was focused more to the ground than towards the sky (A question may arise here that it is reported in Abu Daawud that Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) usually looked towards the sky. Both are reconciled thus: His habit was to look down towards the ground, but he also waited for the wahi (revelation), therefore while waiting he often looked towards the sky. Otherwise he usually looked down towards the ground.His modest habit was to look at something with a light eye, i.e. he looked at a thing, with modesty and bashfulness, hence he did not stare at anything. While walking he asked the Sahabah (Radiallahu anhum) to walk in front, and he himself walked behind. He made salaam to whomsoever he met"</text>

      <text>Saa-ib bin Yazid (Radiallahu anhu) said:</text>
      <text>"My (maternal) aunt took to me to the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) and said to him, this nephew of mine is ill. Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) wiped his holy hand over my head and made for barakah for me. (According to some Ulama, Rasulullah (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) wiped his hand over his head, meant that he Sayyidina Saa-ib bin Yazid (Radiallahu anhu) had a pain in the head. The opinion of this weak and humble servant is that it is better if this is taken to mean that the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) wiped his hands in kindness on the head of Sayyidina Saa-ib bin Yazid (Radiallahu anhu). Sayyidina Saa-ib bin Yazid (Radiallahu anhu) was born in the second year Hijri, and at the time of the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam)'s death, his age was not more than 8 or 9 years. That is why the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) wiped his Holy hand in kindness, as is the customs of the great personalities. The Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) also gave him the water of wudu to drink as a cure, as will be stated further, or he may have prescribed another remedy, especially when we learn also in a narration in Bukhari thay he Sayyidina Saa-ib bin Yazid (Radiallahu anhu)was suffering from pain in his leg). When the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) performed Wudu, I drank the water of that wudu. (The Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) may have performed wudu for some reason, but here it is clear that the Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihe wasallam) performed wudu so that the water could be used as a remedy and medicine). I saw the seal of Prophethood, which was like the knot on a mosquito net or bedstead." (Which is the size of a pigeon's egg in roundness). The Ulama differ in the translation of this word. Some have translated it in another manner. Imam Nawawi, the famous commentator of Sahih Muslim, preferred the translation I have chosen).</text>

      <text>Buraydah bin Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports:</text>
      <text>"when Rasulalullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam came to Medinah, Salmaan Faarisi Radiyallahu 'Anhu brought a tray which had fresh dates on it, and presented it to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, who asked:"O Salmaan, what dates are these?"He replied:"This is sadaqah for you and your companions"Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied:"We do not eat Sadaqah. Remove it from me."(The 'ulama differ in their opinions as to the meaning of the word "we". Some say it is Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam himself, and the plural is used as a mark of respect. Others explain that it is the ambiyaa (prophets). According to some it is Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and his relatives, for whom it is not permissible to accept zakaah. According to this humble servant the third ihtimaal (supposition) is superior and more acceptable. Allaamah Munaawi's criticism of the third explanation is not forceful and weighty). On the next day this happened again. Salmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu brought a tray of fresh dates, and in reply to the question of Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, he replied: "O messenger of Allah, it is a present for you".Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said to the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum "Help yourselves". (Sayyidina Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam himself ate from it. Bayjuri explains this thus: Sayyidina Salmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu bringing the dates on both days in this manner was to investigate, and to make Sayyidina Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam his master. Sayyidina Salmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu was an 'Aalim (learned) of the old days. He lived for a hundred and fifty years and according to some, he lived three hundred years. He had seen the signs of Sayyidina Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam in the kitaabs of previous prophets, that he will not accept sadaqah, but shall accept presents and gifts, and the seal of Prophethood will be between his two shoulders after witnessing the first two signs).He then saw the seal of Prophethood on the back of Sayyidina Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and embraced Islam. (At that time Sayyidina Salmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu was a slave of a Jew from the tribe of Banu Qurayzah.Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam purchased him(this is figuratively speaking. The fact is that Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam made him a Mukaatab - One who buys One's freedom for any agreed sum.) and paid Dirhams for him to become a Mukaatab, and also agreed that he(Sayyidina Salmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu should plant for the Jew date palms,(the amount of three hundred palms) and until these bore fruit to tend them. Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam planted the palms with his mubaarak hands and it was his mu'jizah(miracle) that all the palms bore fruit in the same year. One tree among these did not bear fruit. Upon investigating it was found that Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu had planted this tree, and that it was not planted by Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam removed this palm and replanted it. Another mu'jizah Rasullullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam is that he planted the palms out of season and they bore fruit the same year.</text>

      <text>"I came to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam while there were people sitting in his company. I went around to the back of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam (The narrator may have done this physically). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam understood what I was trying to do. He removed the sheet (body wrap) from his back. I saw the place of the Seal of Prophethood between his two shoulders. It was like a cluster surrounded by til (moles) which appeared to be like a wart. I came before Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and said to him. May Allah forgive you (or Allah has forgiven you, as is mentioned in Surah Fath, 'That Allah may forgive you, your former and your latter sins'). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied: 'May Allah forgive you too'. The people said to me that Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam has made du'aa for your maghfirah (forgiveness). I replied: 'Yes, and for you too, because Allah Ta'aala has said: 'O Muhammad, seek forgiveness for yourself and the Mu'min males and females also"'. (That is why Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam asked for the forgiveness of Muslims).</text>

In the early periods Rasulullah (ﷺ) preferred to follow the Ahlul Kitaab, rather than others, in matters where no command had came from Allah. Later this was abrogated, and Rasulullah (ﷺ) began apposing the ways of the Ahlul Kitaab after this".</text>

      <text>"We were once present in the assembly of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. Food was brought to him. 1 did not observe any food that had so much barakah at the beginning and at the end of which there was no barakah left in the food. We therefore asked Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam reason?. He replied: 'In the beginning we all recited 'Bismillah' before we began eating. Then someone in the end joined us, and did not recite ''Bismillah'. The shaitaan ate with him'".</text>

      <text>Abu Hurairah radiyallahu anhu reports, When the people saw (picked their) new fruit, they used to come and present it to Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam then recited this du'a:</text>
      <text>Transliteration: Allahumma baarik lana fi thimaa-rina wa-baarik lanaa fi madinatinaa wa-baarik lanaa fi saa-'i-naa wa-fi muddinaa-Allahumma-inna Ebraahima 'ab-duka wa-kha-li-luka wa-nabiy-yuka wa-inna ab-duka wa-nabiy-yuka wa-in-nahu da'aa-ka li-makkata wa-inni ad'u-ka lil-madinati bi-mith-li maa da'aaka bihi li-makkata wa-mith-lahu ma'a-hu.Translation: O Allah! Bless us in our fruits. Bless us in our city. Bless us in our Saa', and bless us in our Mudd' (these are two measures used in Madinah to measure dates, etc.). O Allah verily Ibrahim alaihis salaam is Your servant, friend and Nabi (since it was an occasion for humbleness Sayyidina Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam did not mention here his being the habib - beloved - of Alah.) And (whatever) he has supplicated to You for (colonising) Makkah. (Which is mentioned in the aayah,...so incline some hearts of men that they may yearn towards them, and provide Thou them with fruits in order that they may be thankful. - Surah Ibrahim, 37) I supplicate the same to You for Madinah."He then called a small child, to whom he gave that fruit.</text>

      <text>Ibn Abbas radiyallahu anhu reports, Khalid ibn Waleed and I both accompanied Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam to the house of Maymunah. (Ummul Mu'mineen, Maymunah radiyallahu anha was the maternal aunt of both). She served milk in a vessel. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam drank from it. I was on his right and Khalid ibn Waleed on his left. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said the right of drinking is now yours (as you are on the right). If you so wish you could give your right to Khalid. I replied that I would give no one preference from your left over. After that Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, Whenever Allah feeds one something, this du'aa should be recited:</text>
      <text>Allahumma baarik lanaa fihi wa-at'imanaa khayram minhu.(Translation: O Allah grant us barakah in it, and feed us something better than it.)Whenever Allah gives someone milk to drink one should read:Allahumma baarik lanaa fihi wa-zidnaa minhu.(Translation: O Allah grant us barakah in it and increase it for us.)Sayyidinaa Ibn Abbas radiyallahu anhu says that after having something Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam made du'aa for something better than it. And after drinking milk he taught to make du'aa for the increase of it, because Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, There is nothing that serves both as food and water excepting milk.</text>

      <text>Imaam Hasan radiyallahu anhu says, I asked my (maternal) uncle Hind ibn Abi Haalah, who always described the noble features of Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam to describe to me the manner in which Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam spoke. He replied that Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam was always worried (about the hereafter). And always busy thinking (about the attributes of Allah and the betterment of the Ummah). Because of these things he was never free from thought and never rested (or because of worldly affairs he did not gain rest, but gained rest and contentment from religious well being. It is mentioned in the hadith that the coolness of my eyes is in salaah). He always spoke clearly from beginning to end. (He did not speak in a manner where only half sentences are spoken and the other half remained in the mind of the speaker, as is prevalent among snobbish high-minded and proud people). He spoke concisely, where the words are less and meaning more. (Mulla Ali Qaari has collected forty such ahaadith in his commentary which are very short. Those who wish may refer to it and memorise it). Every word was clearer than the previous one. There was no nonsensical talk, nor was there half-talks where the meaning was not complete and could not be grasped. He was not short-tempered, nor did he disgrace anyone. He always greatly appreciated the blessings of Allah even though it might be very minute, he did not criticize it.He did not criticize food, nor over-praised it (The reason for not criticizing food is clear, that it is a blessing from Allah. The reason for not praising it is because it might be felt that one is gluttonous. Nevertheless, he praised food if it was to make someone happy, and sometimes praised some special things). He was never angered for anything materialistic. (The reason being that he did not pay much attention, and did not care much about materialistic things).If someone exceeded the limits in religious matters or against the truth, he became so angry that no one could endure it, nor could anybody stop it till he avenged it. If for some reason he made a gesture or pointed at something, he did it with a full hand. (The ulama say the reason being that it is against humbleness to point with one finger only. Some ulama say it was his noble habit to signal oneness of Allah with one finger, therefore he did not signal anyone in that manner). When he was surprised by something he turned his hands, and when he spoke sometimes while talking, he moved his hands, he sometimes hit the palm of his right hand with the inside part of his left thumb. When he became angry with someone, he turned his face away from that person, and did not pay attention to that person or he forgave that person. When he was happy due to humility it seemed as if he had closed his eyes. The laugh of Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam was mostly a smile, at that moment his mubarak front teeth glittered like white shining hailstone</text>

      <text>Abu Dhar radiyallahu anhu says, Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, I know that person well who will enter Jannah first and also that person who will be the last one to be taken out of Jahannam. On the Day of Qiyaamah a person will be brought forward to the court of Almighty Allah. It shall be commanded that all the minor sins of that person be put forward to him and the major sign be concealed. When the minor sins are disclosed to that person, he will accept that he had committed them, as there will be no room for refuting them. (He will begin to tremble and say in his heart that these are only the minor sins, what will happen when the major sins are exposed.) During this happening it shall be commanded that for every sin of that person he be given the ajr (thawaab-reward) of a good deed. Upon hearing this person himself will say I still have many sins left to account for, that are not seen here.Abu Dhar radiyallahu anhu says, Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam while narrating the words of that person began laughing until his mubarak teeth began to show. (The reason being that the person himself disclosed the very sins he was frightened of.)</text>

      <text>Abdullah ibn Mas'ood radiyallahu anhu said, I know the person who will come out last from the fire. He will be such a man who will crawl out (due to the severity of the punishment of Jahannam he will not be able to walk). He will then be ordered to enter Jannah. He will go there and find that all the places therein are occupied. He will return and say, "O Allah the people have taken all the places." It will be said to him "Do you remember the places in the world?" (That when a place gets filled, there remains no place for a newcomer. And a person that arrives first occupies as much as one pleases, there remains no place for the ones that arrive later. The elders have translated it in this manner. According to this humble servant, if the meaning of it is taken as follows, it seems more appropriate, that do you remember the vastness and plentiness of the world and how big the world was. He is being reminded, because an announcement is going to be made that a place that is ten times greater than the world shall be given to him. After imagining the vastness of the world once, it may be assessed how great this gift is?). He will reply, "O my creator, I remember well." It will be commanded to him "Make your wish in whichever way your heart desires." He will put forward his desires. It shall be commanded. All your desires are fulfilled and in addition ten times the size of the world is granted to you. He will reply, "Are you jesting with me O my Allah, and You are the King of the Kings?" (There is no place in Jannah and You are granting me a place ten times greater than the world). Sayyidina Ibn Mas'ood radiyallahu anhu said, I saw Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam laugh till his mubarak teeth showed, when he related this portion of the man's reply.</text>

      <text>Ali ibn Rabiah radiyallahu anhu says, I was present when a conveyance (A horse or something) was brought to Hazrat Ali radiyallahu anhu (in the period of his khilafah). He recited Bismillah and put his leg in the stirrup. After he had mounted he said Alhamdulillah and recited this dua:</text>
      <text>Translation: Glorified be He Who hath sudued those unto us, and we were not capable (Of subduing them); And lo! Unto our Lord we are returning. (Surah Zukhruf 13-14)(The ulama say that a conveyance could be a means of death. Therefore subjugation of a conveyance with gratitude towards Allah for His Mercy, and death are mentioned together. After all a person has to return to Allah after death). Ali radiyallahu anhu then said Alhamdulillah three times, Allahu Akbar three times, then recited:Translation: Glorified be Thou! Behold, I have wronged myself. So forgive thou me. Indeed, non forgiveth sins but Thou.Then (Sayyidina Ali radiyallahu anhu) laughed (smiled). I said to him, "What is the reason for laughing, O Ameerul Mumineen?" He replied, "Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam also recited these duas in this manner and thereafter laughed (smiled). I also inquired from Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam the reason for laughing (smiling) as you have asked me. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, "Allah Ta'ala becomes happy when His servants say, 'No one can forgive me save You.' My servant knows that no one forgives sins besides me.</text>

Aamir radiyallahu anhu says, "I asked why did he laugh?" he replied, "A Kaafir had a shield, and Sa'd was a great archer. The kaafir protected himself by swaying the shield from side to side covering his forehead. (Sayyidina Sa'd radiyallahu anhu was a famous marksman, but the kaafir did not let the arrows get him). Sa'd radiyallahu anhu took an arrow (and kept it ready in the bow). When the non believer removed the shield from his head, he quickly aimed at the kaafir and did not miss the target, i.e. the (enemy's) forehead. The enemy immediately fell down, his legs rising into the air. On that Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam laughed till his mabaraak teeth showed." I asked, "Why did Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam laugh?" He replied, "Because of what Sa'd had done to the man."</text>

      <text>Anas ibn Malik radiyallahu anhu reports, A resident of the wilderness whose name was Zaahir (ibn Hiraam Al-Ashja'ee), whenever he visited Rasooluallah sallallahu alaihe wasallam he brought with him presents of the wilderness, vegetables etc., and presented it to Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam. When he intended to leave Madinah, Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam used to present him with provisions of the city. Once Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, "Zaahir is our wilderness, and we are his city." Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam was attached to him. Zaahir radiyallahu anhu was not very handsome. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam once approached him while he was selling his merchandise. Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam caught him in between the arms from the back in such a manner that he (Sayyidina Zaahir radiyallahu anhu) could not see him. Zaahir radiyallahu anhu said, "Who is this?, leave me." But when he saw with the corner of his eye that it was Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam, he straightened his back and began pressing it to the chest of Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam (For as long as he gained this opportunity it was better than a thousand gifts). Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam then said, "Who will purchase this slave?" Zaahir radiyallahu anhu replied, "O Rasool of Allah, if you shall sell me, you will be selling a defective thing, and will earn a very little sum." Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam said, "No, you are not defective in the sight of Allah, but very valuable."</text>

Rasoolullah sallallahu alaihe wasallam asked, Do you know what is the original story of Khuraafah? Khuraafah was a man from the tribe of Banu Udhrah, whom the jinns took away. They kept him for some time, then left him among the people. He related to the people strange things of his stay there. The people were astonished.

      <text>Ibn 'Abbaas Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports that he once slept at the house of his aunt Maymunah (during his childhood). She slept on the width of the cushion and Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallarn slept on the length of the cushion. (Qaadi 'Iyaad and others have translated pillow as a bed. When the original word means pillow and it is possible to use it in such a manner, it is not necessary to translate it as a bed. For instance, Sayyidina Rasulullah Saliallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam must have slept on the length of the pillow facing the qiblah, and Sayyidina Ibn 'Abbaas Radiyallahu 'Anhu on the breadth of it, putting his head on the qiblah side). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam (after having a little conversation with his wife) slept till the middle of the night, or till a little before that. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam then awakened and began wiping off the signs of sleep from his face. He then recited the last ten aayaat of Surah Aali 'Imraan (Inna fi khalqis samaawaati wal ard). (The 'ulama say a little of the Qur-aan should be recited after awakening, as this creates strength and it is mustahab to recite these aayaat). He got up and went to a leather bag that was hanging and (took water in a utensil from it) performed wudu from it. He then commenced his salaah. 'Abdullah bin 'Abbaas Radiyallahu 'Anhu says:</text>
      <text>'I also got up (performed wudu) and stood next to-him (on his left). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam put his right hand on my head and caught my ear and twisted it (A muqtadi should stand on the right side of an Imaam. The ear was twisted to remind him. In one narration it is stated that, I began to sleep, so Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam caught my ear. In another narration it is stated he caught my ear and pulled me to his right side, so that I might stand on the right according to the sunnah). He performed two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two, rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs, then two rak'ahs. Ma'n (a narrator of this hadith) says Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam recited two two rak'ahs six times (the total of twelve rak'ahs. Mulla 'Ali Qaari has written that according to the madh-hab of Imaam Aa'zam Abu Hanifah, in tahajjud prayers there are twelve rak'ahs). He then performed the witr salaah and slept. When the mu-adh-dhin (Sayyidina Bilaal Radiyallahu'Anhu) came to him, he got up and recited two short rak'ahs and went for the fajr salaah.</text>

      <text>"I once made up my mind that today I will closely study how Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam performed his prayers. I lay down on the threshold of the house or a tent of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam (so that I may have a chance to observe with close attention). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam first performed two short rak'ahs. After that he performed long, long, long rak'ahs. (Long is mentioned thrice because of the lengthy periods spent in the rak'ahs). He then performed two rak'ahs shorter than the previous one's. Then performed two rak'ahs shorter than that. And again performed two rak'ahs shorter than the previous one. He again performed two rak'ahs shorter than that. He then performed the witr. All these (amounted to) thirteen rak'ahs"</text>

      <text>"Rasulullah Sallallhu 'Alayhi Wasallam did not perform more than eleven rak'ahs during Ramadhaan or after Ramadhaan. (Eight rak'ahs tahajjud and three rak'ahs witr). He performed four rak'ahs. Do not ask of its length or how wonderfully (i.e. with humbleness and concentration) it was performed. In the same manner he performed four more rak'ahs. In the same manner he again performed four rak'ahs, and do not ask of its length or how wonderfully it was performed. After that he performed three rakahs witr". Aayesha Radiyallahu 'Anha says "I said: "O Messenger of Allah. Do you sleep before you perform witr?" He replied: "O Aayesha, my eyes sleep, but my heart remains awake". (This is a special gift to the ambiyah (prophets) that their hearts remain awake at all times)</text>

      <text>Hudhayfah bin Al Yamaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu says he performed salaah with Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam one night. (It has been reported in a few narrations that this incident took place during a night of Ramadaan. It is possible that this was tahajjud or Taraweeh salaah). After commencing the salaah he recited:</text>
      <text>Allahu Akbar, dhul malakuti wal jabaruti wal kibri-yaa-i wal a-za-mati.Translation: Allah is supreme! Lord of Dominion, Power, Majesty, and Magnificence.He then recited (after the Faatihah) Surah Baqarah, and performed ruku'. The length of the ruku' was as long as the qiyaam (standing posture). (The 'ulama give two meanings to this and both are possible. The first is that the ruku' was as long as the qiyaam. For example, if the qiyaam was for one hour, the ruku' was also for about one hour. Accordingly, this mas-alah is established, that if the ruku' and sajdah are longer than normal, the salaah will be valid. The second is that the qiyaam was longer than normal. In this instance if the qiyaam was for an hour, and the ruku' for fifteen minutes, then too it will be truly explaining this hadith. According to this saying the salaah remains in the normal manner. i.e. a fundamental action of salaah that was long, like qiyaam, remained long. And those that were short, like ruku' or sajdah, remained short. But certainly every fundamental action was longer than normal). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam repeated:Subhaana rabbiyal azimi-Subhaana rabbiyal azimi.Translation: Glory be to my Lord the Magnificient.He lifted his head from the ruku' and stood. This standing was also long like that of the ruku'. At this moment he repeated:Li rabbiyal hamdu-Li rabbiyal hamdu.Translation: All praises are for my Lord. All praises are for my Lord.He then performed the sajdah. The sajdah was as long as the qawmah (standing in between the ruku' and sajdah). and he recited:Subhaana rabbiyal aa'laa-Subhaana rabbiyal aa'laa.Translation: Glory be to my Lord the Exalted. Glory be to my Lord the Exalted.He then sat up from the sajdah. This sitting was also long as that of the sajdah. Here he repeated:Rabbigh-fir lee-Rabbig-fir lee.Translation: O Lord forgive me. O Lord forgive me.Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam recited in this salaah Surah Baqarah, Surah Aali 'Imraan, Surah Nisaa, Surah Maa-idah or Surah An'aam. The narrator (Sayyidina Shu'ba Radiyallahu'Anhu) is in doubt regarding the last two surahs, whether is it Maa-idah or An'aam.</text>

      <text>'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha says:</text>
      <text>"Once at night (salaah time), Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam kept on repeating one aayah. Commentary: The aayah is the last aayah of Surah Maa-idah:In tu-adh-dhib-hum fa-innahum 'ibaaduk. Wa in tagh-fir lahum fa-innaka antal azizul hakim.Translation: "If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them, (lo! the are Thy slaves).Lo! Thou, only Thou, art Mighty, the wise".Surah Maa-idah, 118.The Being that possesses great power, if He wills, He may forgive the criminal. The One that is all Wise, there is Wisdom and benefit in every act of His. The reason for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam reciting this aayah while standing and also in the ruku and sajdah, and repeating it many times, is to bring to mind the two attributes of Allah, namely the attributes of justice and forgiveness. The whole scene on the day of qiyaamah will be of these two things. It is stated that Imaam Aa'zam Abu Hanifah RA. also recited the following aayah the whole night:Wamtaazul yauma ayyuhal mujrimun.Translation: "But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!" Surah Yaseen, 58.In this aayah too the scene of qiyaamah is portrayed. That today the sinners should separate and distinguish themselves. What a severe and nerve-chilling command this is. Today they are together with the pious and holy people and benefiting from the barakaat (blessings) they receive, but at this moment the sinners will be separated from them. May the Most Merciful Allah with His Grace keep those pious souls under His shadow, otherwise it is really a time for great trials.</text>

If he recited whilst sitting, he performed the ruku' and sajdah in a sitting posture".</text>

      <text>"We asked'Ali about the nawaafil that Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam performed in the day". (He must have known already about the nawaafil of the night i.e. tahajjud etc. Many well known narrations have been narrated regarding the tahajiud) 'Ali Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: "You do not have the strength to perform these." (i.e. The importance, punctuality, humility and humbleness Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam attached to performing these prayers, cannot be fulfilled. The reason for saying this was to admonish, as what benefit is there simply by asking and investigating, until an effort is not made to practise these) We replied: "The one amongst us who has the strength, will perform it"., (Those who do not possess the strength, will learn so that others could be guided and an effort will be made to practise). 'Ali Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: "In the morning when the sun rises to the height of that, the same as it is at the time for 'asr. At that time Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam performed two rak'ahs (Salaatul ish-raaq). When the sun rose in the east to the height, where it is in the west at the time of zuhr salaah, he performed four rak'ahs (salaatut duha-chaast, this will be explained in the ensuing chapter). He performed four rak'ahs before the salaah of zuhr, and two after (These six rak'ahs are sunnah mu-akkidah). Four rak'ahs were performed before 'asr. In between the four rak'ahs he sat and sent salutations on the malaa-ikah.muqarrabeen, the ammbiyaa and the mu-mineen"</text>

(Sayyidina ibn Mas'ud Radiyallahu 'Anhu may have thought this recital was for tabligh as a reminder) Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'I love to hear it from another person'' Thereupon I began reciting Surah Nisaa (which begins from the last quarter of the 4th juz). When I reached this aayah: ''But how (will it be with them) when We bring of every people a witness, and We bring thee (O Muhammed) a witness against these?''-Surah Nisaa,41 I saw tears flowing from both eyes of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam.</text>

      <text>'Abdullah bin 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports:</text>
      <text>"In the time of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam there once occurred a solar eclipse (According to the majority of the 'ulama this incident took place in the tenth year hijri). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam went into the masjid, commenced salaah, and stood in qiyaam for so long that it was felt that he did not intend to perform the ruku'. (In another narration it is stated that he recited the Surah Baqarah.) He then performed such a long ruku as if he did not want to come up from the Ruku'. Then in the same manner after standing up from the ruku' he stood up for such a long time as if he did not want to perform sajdah, here too he kept his mubaarak head on the ground for such a long time as if he was not going to lift his mubaarak head. In this manner he did the same after lifting the head and sitting in jalsa, and after the jalsa in the second sajdah.In short, in every rukn of the salaah this was done, that every rukn was so long, as if this rukn was going to be performed till the end, and there is nothing after it. (In the same manner he performed the second rak'ah, and in the last sajdah), due to the intense fear he began taking heavy breaths and crying, and began pleading to the Almighty Allah that 'O Allah, it is only You that have promised that when these people make istighfaar there will be no punishment'. This saying of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam refers to the aayah that is at the end of the ninth juz: ''But Allah would not punish them while thou was with them, nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness. - Surah Al-Anfaal, 33.When Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam completed the salaah, the sun had cleared already. Rasulullah Sallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam delivered a sermon after this. After uttering the hamd and thanaa, he talked o this subject, that the sun and moon does not eclipse because of the death or birth of anyone, but both are from among the signs of Allah Ta'aala. (That gives His creation a warning so that they may fear Him). When the eclipses occurs then immediately turn towards Allah (begin istighfaar and performing salaah)"</text>

She replied: 'It was a canvas folded into two, which was spread for Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam to sleep on. On one night I thought if I folded it into four and spread it, it would become softer. I folded it and spread it that way. In the morning Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam asked: 'What did you spread for me last night? I replied: 'It was the same bed, I only folded it into four so that it may become softer'.

      <text>Imaam Hasan bin 'Ali Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports that I asked my (maternal) uncle Hind bin Abi Haalab, who usually described particulars and conditions of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. I was longing to hear something about it. On my asking, he described the mubaarak features of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. He said:</text>
      <text>'Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam had great qualities and attributes in him, others also held him in high esteem. His face glittered like the full moon'. He then described the complete features of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam (as has been mentioned in the first chapter under hadith number seven). Imaam Hasan Radiyallahu 'Anhu says. 'I did not mention this hadith (due to some reason) to Husayn (Radiyallahu 'Anhu) for some time. Then I once narrated it to him whereupon I found that he had heard it before me. He had asked him (our uncle) already what I had asked. I also found that he had asked our father ('Ali Radiyallahu 'Anhu) about Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi 'Wasallam entering and coming out of the house. He did not leave out anything about the ways and manners of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. Imaam Husayn Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'I asked my father regarding the manner in which Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam entered the house?' He replied: 'When Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam entered the house he distributed his time into three portions; He spent a portion for Allah. (In devotion, performing salaah etc.); A portion towards his family (fulfilling their duties. i.e. laughing, speaking, enquiring about their welfare etc.); and a portion for himself (resting etc.). He distributed his personal portion in two, one for himself and one for the people, in such a manner that the near one's among the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum came to visit him. Through these Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum he conveyed messages to the people. He did not conceal anything from them. From the portion of the unimah he adopted this method, that he gave preference to the Ahlul-Fadl (i.e. people of 'ilm and 'amal). He distributed this time according to their religious fadl. From among those who came, some had one requirement, some had two requirements, and some had many requirements. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam fulfilled all their requirements. He busied them in things that benefited them and the entire ummah. When they questioned Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam on religious matters, he replied to them in a manner that benefited them. He used to say: 'Those that are present, should inform those that are not present regarding these beneficial and necessary matters'. He also used to say: 'Those people who for some reason (purdah, distance, shyness or awe) cannot put forward their requirements, you should inform me about their requirements, because, that person who informs a king of the need of another, who is unable to put forward that need, Allah Ta'aala will keep that person stead fast on the day of qiyaamah'. Only important and beneficial matters were discussed in his gathering. He happily listened to these matters from the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum. Besides this there was no wasteful or non-beneficial talks in his assemblies. The Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum came to the assemblies of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam for their religious needs, they did not depart before tasting something (by tasting, may be meant the acquiring of religious knowledge. It could mean 'Hissi' tasting too. Whatever Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam possessed, he offered it in humbleness. Whenever close friends gather, whatever is available is presented to them). The Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum returned from his assemblies as torch bearers of hidayah and goodness. (They spread. these teachings amongst others). Imaam Husayn Radiyallahu 'Anhu says: 'I asked (my father) regarding the coming out of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam from the house'. He replied: 'Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam controlled his tongue and only spoke that which was necessary. He did not waste his time in useless conversations. He made those who came to visit him feel at home he did not make them feel scared or ill at ease. (i.e. When advising them, he did not scold them in a manner that they become scared, or tell them such things that would keep them away from the deen). He respected and honoured the respected ones of every nation. He also chose a leader for them. He warned the people of Allah's punishment (or he emphasised that the people be cautious). He also protected himself from troubling or harming people. Besides being cautious and commanding others to be cautious, he never lacked in courtesy towards others. He was concerned for the affairs of his friends, made himself aware about the relationships between them and rectified their faults. He praised good deeds and encouraged them. He explained the harmful effects of bad things and removed and stopped these. He followed the middle path in all matters. (He did not at times say this and at other times that). He did not neglect the guiding of people, it is possible that they became unmindful of their religious duties, or exceeded in a matter resulting in them becoming disheartened. For everything there was a special arrangement. He did not fall back in the truth, nor did he exceed the limits in this.Those who attended his gatherings were the best of people. The best person in the eyes of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam was the one who wished everybody well. The one with the highest status in the eyes of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam was that person who considered, comforted and helped the creation the most'. Sayyidina Imaam Husayn Radiyallahu 'Anhu says: 'I then enquired from him regarding the assemblies of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu Wasallam'. He replied: 'He began and ended all his sitting with the dhikr of Allah. When he went to a place, he sat where he found a place, and also instructed the people to do so. They should not leap over peoples heads and go ahead. It is a different matter, that where Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam sat, that place became the focal point of the gathering. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam fulfilled the rights of every person present. That means, whatever right was due in talking and showing happiness, was fulfilled by him, so much so, that every person present would think that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam is honouring me the most. The person that came to sit by Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam or came to him for some purpose, Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam would remain seated till that person began to stand up. Whenever one asked him for something, he kindly fulfilled that request, and did not refuse it, (if he did not possess the thing) he would give a soft and humble answer. His cheerfulness and pleasant manner were for everybody. He was like a father to them. The whole creation was equal before him as far as rights were concerned. His gatherings were the gatherings of knowledge, modesty, patience and honesty. (i.e. These four things were attained there or are a description of his gatherings). Voices were not raised therein, nor was anyone degraded or disgraced. If anyone committed a fault, it was not made known publicly. All were regarded as equals amongst themselves. (A person was not regarded according to his lineage or genealogy). The virtues of one over the other was according to the taqwa (piety) possessed. The small ones were loved. The needy were given preference. Strangers and travellers were cared for"</text>

When wahi was revealed to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, he sent for me, I came and wrote it. (Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam always showed kindness, and made us feel at ease). Whatever we discussed, he discussed the same. If we discussed some worldly affairs, he also spoke of it. (It was not that he only spoke about the hereafter to us, and despised the talking of worldly affairs). When we spoke of the hereafter, he too spoke of the hereafter. When we began speaking of the hereafter, he described its events etc in detail). 'When we spoke of food, Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam also spoke of it. (Its etiquette, benefits, tasty foods, foods that are harmful, etc. In the previous chapters many such commands of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam are mentioned. i.e. 'What a wonderful curry vinegar is'. 'Use olive oil, it is from a mubaarak tree'. etc.). All this I am saying are facts on Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam'".</text>

      <text>"A person who was wearing yellow coloured clothing was sitting by Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. It was the habit of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam not to bluntly express things he did not approve of. (Therefore he kept silent). When that person left, Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said to those present 'It would have been better if you had told him not to wear yellow clothing'".</text>

      <text>Imaam Hasan Radiyallahu 'Anhu says, (my younger brother) Husayn said:</text>
      <text>"I asked my father (Sayyidina 'Ali Radiyallahu 'Anhu) about the conduct of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam in his assemblies' He replied.. 'Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam was always happy and easy mannered. There was always a smile and a sign of happiness on his blessed face. He was soft-natured and when the people needed his approval, he easily gave consent. He did not speak in a harsh tone nor was he stone-hearted. He did not scream while speaking, nor was he rude or spoke indecently. He did not seek other's faults. He never over-praised anything nor exceeded in joking, nor was he a miser. He kept away from undesirable language and did not make as if he did not hear anything. If he did not agree with the next person's wish he did not make that person feel disheartened, nor did he promise anything to that person. He completely kept himself away from three things: from arguments, pride and senseless utterances. He prohibited people from three things. He did not disgrace or insult anyone, nor look for the faults of others, he only spoke that from which thawaab and reward was attained. When he spoke, those present bowed their heads in such a manner, as if birds were sitting on their heads. (They did not shift about, as birds will fly away on the slightest move). When he completed his talks, the others would begin speaking. (No one would speak while Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam spoke. Whatever one wanted to say, it would be said after he had completed speaking). They did not argue before him regarding anything. Whenever one spoke to him the other would keep quiet and listen till he would finish. The speech of every person was as if the first person was speaking. (They gave attention to what every person said. It was not as is generally found that in the beginning people pay full attention, and if the talk is lengthened they became bored, and begin to pay less attention). When all laughed for something, he would laugh too. The things that surprised the people, he would also show his surprise regarding that. (He would not sit quietly and keep himself aloof from everyone, but made himself part of the gathering). He exercised patience at the harshness and indecent questions of a traveller. (Villagers usually ask irrelevant questions. They do not show courtesy and ask all types of questions. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam did not reprimand them but exercised patience). The Sahaabah would bring travellers to his assemblies (so that they themselves could benefit from the various types of questions asked by these people, and also hear some questions regarding which they themselves, due to etiquette, would not ask). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam' would say: 'When you see a person in need, then always 'help that person'. (If someone praised him, he would detest it). If someone, by way of thanks praised him, he would remain silent, (because it is necessary that one 'thank a person for a good favour or good deed. It is like one fulfilling one's duty. Some of the 'ulama have translated this as: 'If one did not exceed in praising him, he would keep silent'. That means if he exceeded he would prohibit him). He did not interrupt someone talking and did not begin speaking when someone else was busy speaking. If one exceeded the limits he would stop him or would get up and leave (so that that person would stop)"</text>

He himself led a simple life, but in giving he would put a king to shame. At a time of great need a woman presented him a sheet, and he wore it as he was in need of it. A person came to him, and asked him for it, he presented the sheet to that person. Taking of loans and fulfilling the needs of others, when the creditors came, and if something had come from somewhere, he would pay the debts, and did not go home till everything was given to the needy. There exists many incidents of this nature, so much so that it is not possible to enumerate them). Particularly in the month of Ramadaan, he would be more generous till the month ended. (His generosity in this month exceeded all the other months). In this month when Jibra-eel 'Alayhis Salaam came and recited the Qur-aan to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, at that time his generosity exceeded the wind that brings forth heavy rains".</text>

Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam felt annoyed at this saying of 'Umar Radiyallahu'Anhu. Thereupon a person from among, the Ansaar said: "O Rasul, of Allah, spend whatever you wish, and do not fear any lessening from the Lord of the 'Arsh (Throne)". (That Great Deity that is the Lord of the 'Arsh, nothing will decrease in His Bounties by giving you). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam smiled and the happiness could be seen on his mubaarak face due to the saying of the Ansaari. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam than said: "Allah Ta'aala has commanded me to do this".</text>

      <text>Abu Hurayrah Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports:</text>
      <text>"Once Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam came out of his house at such a time, that it was not his noble habit to do so at that time. Nor did anyone come to meet him at that time. At that moment Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu came to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. He asked: 'What brought you here, O Abubakr?' Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'I came out to meet the Rasul of Allah, and look at his noble face. (This was due to the complete relationship of Abubakr Siddiqe Radiyallahu 'Anhu, that when Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam unexpectedly came out of his house, it had an effect on Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu. According to this humble servant, this is the best explanation, and this complete relationship is the reason for the continuity of the khilaafah of Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu with the nabawi period after the death of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. If someone else had been elected as a khalifah, then due to the incomplete relationship, there would have been some changes in the laws of the time. It would have been an additional sorrow after the demise of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam for the Sahaabah, and would have been unacceptable to them, whereas, Abubakr Radiyallahu'Anhu had such a close and deep relationship with Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam that on many aspects Abubakr Siddiqe Radiyallahu 'Anhu had the same thoughts as that of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam. The incident of Hudaybiyyah is a testimony to this, which has already been mentioned in the book: 'Stories of the Sahaabah'. The Muslims felt so much humilation in accepting the harsh conditions of the non-believers that many among the Sahaabah could not bear it. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu anxiously came to Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, are you not the truthful Nabi of Allah?' Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied: 'Indeed, I am'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'Are we not on The Haq (True Path) and the enemy on falsehood?' Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied: 'Truly indeed'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'Why are we being degraded in this manner in our deen?' Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied: "I am the Messenger of Allah, and I cannot disobey Him. Verily He is my protector'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'Did you not say to us that we are going to Makkah, and are going to perform the tawaaf?' Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'Verily it is true, but did I say that we will go this year to Makkah?' 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'No, you did not say this'. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam then said: 'We will surely go to Makkah and perform tawaaf'. After this 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu with the same zeal went to Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anbu and said: 'O Abubakr, is this not the truthful Nabi of Allah?' Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'Verily, yes'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu asked: 'Are we not on the truth and the non-believers on falsehood?' Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'Verily, true'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu then said: 'Why are we being disgraced in this manner for our deen?' Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'O man, without doubt, he is the truthful nabi, and he does not disobey Allah in the least, and only Allah is his protector. Hold fast unto his reigns'. 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'Did he not say to us that we will be going to Makkah, and will be performing the tawaaf?' Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'Did he promise you this that we will go this year?' 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu replied: 'No, he did not say this to us'. Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu said. 'You will go to Makkah and will also perform tawaaf '. This incident has been mentioned in detail in the Bukhaari.' There are many other similar amazing incidents. Even when Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam committed an ijtihaadi slip up, Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu would also in that instance have the same opinion, as was the case with the prisoners of the Battle of Badr, the incident of which is mentioned at the end of Suratul Anfaal.In this case Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu presenting himself at an unusual moment is the case of the soul of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam having an influence on the heart of Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu, as if he was also feeling hungry.I remember everything of the Sorrow of separation O (beloved) Zaalim But I forget everything after seeing your countenance.Some of the 'ulama state the coming of Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu was due to hunger, but after seeing Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam this feeling of hunger vanished. Therefore on the inquiry of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam, he did not mention this.Some of the 'ulama have written that Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu came due to the hunger he experienced, but he did not mention this, because it may become difficult for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, for the difficulties of a friend supersedes the difficulties of one's self). A little while passed, when 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu presented himself. Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam asked him the reason of presenting himself at such an odd time. He replied: 'Because of hunger, O Messenger of Allah'. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'I am also experiencing a bit of that'. All then went to the house of Abul Haytham Ansaari Radiyallahu'Anhu. He was the owner of many date palms, trees and sheep, and he did not have any servants. (For this reason he did all the work himself). They did not find him there. They asked his wife, 'Where is your companion?' She replied: 'He has gone to bring sweet water for us'. A little while had not passed, when Abul Haytham Radiyallahu 'Anhu experiencing difficulty arrived carrying the water bag. He put it down. He then came and honoured Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, his noble guest, and was pleased by the honour of meeting Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, (and proud of his good fortune, reciting and embracing him).O companion when my benevolent moments will come. Without invitation you will come away to my home.and began to sacrifice on Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam his father and mother. (i.e. He was saying, may my father and mother be sacrificed on you). After that he requested them to come to his palm grove. He spread out for them a mat, then went to a palm and brought a,whole bunch (which had ripe, half ripe etc. kinds of dates on it), and put it before them. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'Why did you not only pick the ripe ones'. (rather than bringing the whole bunch). He (the host) said. 'Eat what pleases you from it'. They ate from it, and drank water. Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said there after, (of which every moment of his life was a means of education for the ummah), I swear an oath by the Being in whose hands lies my life, this is also included among those blessings of which one will be asked on the day of qiyaamah, (which Allah Ta'aala has mentioned at the end of Surah Takathur. It will be asked regarding gratitude. He then counted the blessings of that moment), the cool shadow, good fresh dates, and cold water. Thereafter the host started going to prepare meals, whereupon Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam said to him, in happiness do not just slaughter any animal, but slaughter an animal that does not give milk. The host slaughtered for them a female or male young goat. (He quickly prepared the food), and presented it before them. They partook of it' (Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam noticed that he was doing all the work by himself, and at the beginning he had brought the sweet water himself too). Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam inquired: 'Have you not any servants?' He replied: 'No' Whereupon Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'When slaves shall arrive, remind us. Incidentally only two slaves were brought to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. Abul Haytham Radiyallahu 'Anhu came to remind Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam of his promise. Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'Choose any one of them'. (Where will such a Sahaabi who has sacrificed himself for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam put forward his own desire in the presence of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. Therefore,) He said: 'O Nabi of Allah, you choose one for me'. (Besides piety, there could have been no other reason for liking and choosing a slave) Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'An adviser is trustworthy (and by me being the trustworthy person) I choose this slave for you, as I had seen him perform his salaah. Remember my one advice, and that is to treat him well'. (First Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam mentioned the rule an adviser must adopt. Then reminded that my choice will be a responsible and trustworthy one. He then chose one and gave his reason for it, that the slave is one that upkeeps the salaah, therefore this slave was given preference. In our times, for an employee to be punctual with the salaah is a fault,' as it hinders the work of the employer). Abul Haytham Radiyallahu 'Anhu went (happily home, that he had someone to help him in his chores) to his wife, and told her what Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam had said. His wife said: "You will not be able to fulfil exactly that which Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam had commanded. It is difficult for us to truly carry out that noble advice, therefore free him, for by this it will be possible to fulfil the commands of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam'. The husband then said,. 'He is free'. (He did not care the least for his troubles and difficulties. When Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam came to know about this honourable sacrifice) Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'For every nabi and his successors Allah Ta'aala creates two concealed advisers. One of which induces to do good and saves from committing evil. The other advises not to care the least in ruining and destroying a person. The one that is saved from this persons wickedness, is being saved from all ruin and destruction".</text>

      <text>Sa'd bin Abi Waqqias Radiyallahu 'Anhu reports that from the ummah of Muhammad Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam I was the first to take the blood of a non-believer, and I was the first to shoot an arrow in the path of Allah.We (the group of Sahaabah in the early period of Islaam) went for jihaad in such a state, where we had nothing to eat. We ate the leaves of tree and pods of the acacia tree. As a result our jaw became ulcerous and wounded, and because of the leaves our excreta was like that of sheep and camel. After that too the people of Banu Asad threatened me. If the status of my ignorance in the deen is such as these people claim, then this world and the hereafter is lost. (The days in this world have been spent in poverty and difficulty, and the state of the deen is this that I do not have knowledge of salaah too).</text>

      <text>Khaalid bin 'Umayr Radiyallahu 'Anhu and Shaweesa Radiyallahu 'Anhu Reported that 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu instructed 'Utbah bin "Anhu Ghazwaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu that he should go with his companions (who consisted of three hundred mujahideen) towards the 'Ajami lands. And said:</text>
      <text>When you reach the boundary of the 'Arabian country, set up camp there". (The reason was that 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu received 10 reports that the 'Ajamis intended attacking the 'Arab lands. In other narrations Yazdajard had asked the 'Ajamis for aid. This was on their path. For this reason 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu sent an army to set up a blockade and seal the way) The army left, and when they reached Marbad Basrah, they saw strange white stones. The people first began asking one another, 'what is this?' The people said it was Basrah. (Basrah in the original language means whitish stones. Subsequently this became the name of the town. As if they had answered that this was also a type of stone). After that they went forward (according to the instructions of 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu) till they reached the small bridge (of the Dajlah). The people said, this is the place (that 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu had chosen), and set up camp there. The narrator narrated the full incident (i.e. the coming of the army from Khuraasaan and the victory of 'Utbah Radiyallahu 'Anhu). (As the intention of Imaam Tirmidhi is to describe the hardships and poverty, which will be mentioned at the end of the narration, he has shortened this narration. 'Utbah Radiyallahu 'Anhu recited a khutbah after the victory, which is mentioned in the 'Arabic commentary. In this khutbah, he mentioned the temporary nature of this world, and that the hereafter is everlasting and eternal etc. After the hamd and thana, he said: "The world is going to come to an end, and it is turning its face and going away. Only so much of the world is left, as when water is used up from a dish, and in the end only a little drop is left in it. You are going towards such a world which is everlasting and which will never come to an end. Therefore it is necessary that you go to such a world with the best you can attain, because it has been shown to us that jahannam - which is the abode for those who disobey Allah is so deep that if a pebble is thrown into it from the upper portion, it will not reach the bottom after seventy years. This place will be packed with people. How important it is that we take heed at this place. We have also been shown that jannah-which is the abode for those who obey Allah is so vast that the width of its door from one side to the other is the distance of forty years. It will also be filled with people. Therefore adopt only such deeds that will save one from the first abode, and will gain for one entrance in the abode of Allah's Pleasure. After that he mentioned his past condition, "I had witnessed with Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam this conditions that I am from among those seven people who were with Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. We had nothing with us besides the leaves of trees for eating. Our mouths became bruised by eating it. Incidentally I obtained a sheet, which I shared in half with Sa'd. (Even in this world of distress and difficulty, Allah Ta'aal, blessed them with this reward). There is none among the seven of us who has not been appointed an amir of some place. (Because this group endured many hardships and made many sacrifices before they were appointed amirs, therefore the treatment of their groups was of the best which will be known from the experiences of the Amirs after this) You will in the near future experience the trials of those who will come after this".</text>

After he had taken a bath, bread and meat was brought in a big utensil. Upon seeing this 'Abdurrahmaan Radiyallahu 'Anhu began to cry. I asked: 'What happened, why are you crying?'. He began saying: 'Till the demise of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, nor did he, nor his family members ever fill their stomachs even if it was only with bread that was made of barley. Now after Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam, as far as I can think, this wealthy status of ours is not for any good'.</text>

The people began moving back (in happiness after seeing him, thinking that he would come to join them. Before this too on an occasion when Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam became ill, Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu led the salaah. When he was recovering he would come and join the congregational prayer). Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam made a sign to the people to remain in their places.

      <text>Saalim bin 'Ubayd Radiyallahu 'Anhu, a sahaabi narrates:</text>
      <text>"Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam became unconscious (many times) during his (last) illness. When he became conscious he would ask: 'Is it already time for salaah?' When they replied yes, he would say: 'Instruct Bilaal to call out the adhaan, and instruct Abubakr to lead the salaah'. This happened a few times.(He said this because he was too ill to go to the masjid. Sayyidinia Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu was naturally soft-natured. Many a time he would weep easily. Sayyiditina 'Aayesha Radiallallahu 'Anha knew her fathers relationship with Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallhu 'Alayhi Wasallam and that he would not be able to withstand the absence of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallain. Therefore 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha made a request. 'My father has a soft heart. If he is going to stand on your place and lead the salaah, he will begin to weep, and will not be able to lead the salaah. Therefore, request someone else to lead the salaah'. In this manner after 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha had made several requests;- Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam replied: 'Do you wish to become of those women in the incident of Yusuf ('Alayhis Salaam). Instruct Abubakr to lead the salaah'. (The 'ulama have given their opinions on the saying of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam that. 'You are like the women of Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam'. The first is that by you 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha is meant, and by women only Zulaykha is meant. The plural is used as a mark of respect. According to this saying. (a.) The example is given of stressing on talking of things that are of no value, like Zulaykha stressed Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam to do something which was unadvisable and improper. In the same manner you are stressing on a thing which is out of place and incorrect. (b.) just as Zulaykha invited those women who tormented her, outwardly it was an invitation, but the actual reason was that they see the handsomeness and beauty of Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam and will excuse this wickedness of hers. In the sane manner Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha outwardly said this that Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu is soft-natured. He will not be able to stand on your place (in salaah), but she had this in mind, as mentioned by her on another occasion that: "What made me repeat this to Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, was that according to me the people would never like such a person, who stands on the place of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam, and will think of him as unlucky and unfortunate".The second explanation is that by 'you', Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha and Sayyiditina Hafsah Radiyallahu 'Anha are meant, and by the women of Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam, those women are meant who were invited by Zulaykha. According to this saying too, the following is said: (a.) The example is given on useless talk that both Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha and Sayyiditina Hafsah Radiyallahu 'Anha were stressing something that was improper. In some narrations it is also mentioned that Sayyiditina Hafsah Radiyallahu 'Anha stressed on the same thing. (b.) This similarity is to show and stress on a thing that is not in the heart. Sayyiditina 'Aayeshah Radiyallahu 'Anha had in mind, that if the people see Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu standing on the place of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, they will begin to have evil thoughts of Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu'Anhu being very unfortunate and unlucky. She also persuaded Sayyiditina Hafsah Radiyallahu 'Anha, the daughter of Sayyidina 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu to think alike and side with her, and that Sayyiditina Hafsah Radiyallahu 'Anha may feel the greatness for her father Sayyidina Umar Radiyallahu'Anhu, and may also fancy that he would fulfil the position of a successor. Therefore Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam described to her the similitude of the women of Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam. They outwardly declared their approval of Zulaykha's behaviour with Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam, but secretly each one tried to attract Yusuf 'Alayhis Salaam towards themselves. Some of the 'ulama have given other reasons too. Since this is a lengthy hadith, the commentary is being mentioned briefly here. The translation of the remaining portion of this hadith will be mentioned later, where necessary. an explanation is also given. In some narrations it has also been mentioned that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said that Allah Ta'aala and the Muslims would not accept anyone else besides Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu.Carrying out the instructions of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu led the salaah. (He performed seventeen salaahs till the death of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam. This incident which is mentioned above began on a Thursday evening. On Thursday the illness of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam became worse. All this took place at the time of 'eshaa on Friday night (Thursday night in common usage). From this salaah onwards Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu began leading the prayers. Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam passed away on a Monday just before midday. Therefore the total number of salaah led by Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu till the death of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam is seventeen prayers, which Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu performed continuously. According to this humble servant the illness of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam had begun long before this, hence Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu had led the salaah on a number of occasions.)Once during the illness, Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam felt a bit well during the time of salaah. He asked if there was anyone who could support him till the masjid, Barirah and another person offered themselves, held him by his mubaarak hands and took him to the masjid. Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu sensing the arrival of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam, thought of moving back. Rasulullah Sallallah 'Alayhi Wasallam signaled him to remain there. Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu completed the salaah. After that Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam passed away. (He passed away on a Monday).It is apparent what difficulties and hardships the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum experienced at this time, also bearing in mind the mischief of the munaafiqeen-hypocrites and enemies. The upkeep and safeguarding of the garden that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam nurtured for twenty three years. Together with all this the passing away of the blessed and noble personality of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam, who was so beloved, for whom the Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum had sacrificed their homes, family and relatives. On this morning it seemed that he was recovering, actually he was sustaining it and not recovering. After the death of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam the news spread quickly, but many people could not believe it. Therefore, 'Umar (a respected and strong hearted person with all the virtues, courage, tolerance etc. could not bear it, and in this state unsheathed his sword and stood up and) began saying, "I swear by Allah that Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam has not passed away. The person saying Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam had passed away. I will severe that person's head with my sword". He (Saalim) said, the people were ummis (unlettered-they did read or write), nor was there a nabi among them before this, therefore all those present kept silent. They (the Sahaabah) said to Saalim go to the companion of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and call him.(He is the only one that will bring the boat to shore at this stormy period. Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu after seeing that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam was feeling better had taken leave from Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam to go and visit his family which was about the distance of a mile away). I went to Abubakr (Radiyallahu 'Anhu) in the state of shock and tears were flowing from my eyes. At that time he was in the masjid. Upon seeing my state asked: 'Did Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) pass away? I conveyed the news to him and also said to him that 'Umar had said, if he heard anyone saying Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) has died, he would cut off that person's head with that sword of his. Abubakr said, "Let's go". I went with him. He reached the house while the people were gathering around Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam). He said: 'O people, make way for me'. The people made way for him. He gave a deep look at the mubaarak face of Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and kissed his forehead, then recited this aayah:"Lo! thou will die, and lo! they will die..." - Surah Zumur, 30.Then they (Sahaabah Radiyallahu 'Anhum) asked: 'O Companion (Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu) of Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) has Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) really passed away?' He replied: 'Yes'. Now they accepted. (After that they asked him other questions, because in every question there was a peculiarity.) They said: 'O Companion of Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam), should janaazah salaah be performed for Rasulullah?' He replied: 'Yes'. They said: 'And how?' He said: 'A group at a time enter the room and perform the janazah salaah individually without jamaa'ah, and return. In this manner all will perform this salaah'. They (the Sahaabah) asked. 'O Companion of Rasulullah (Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam) shall Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam be buried?' He replied: 'Yes' They inquired: 'Where?' He replied: 'At the spot where Allah had taken his ruh. Verily'Allah Ta'aala has not taken his ruh but at a venerated place'. They (Sahaabah) knew he said the truth (and became satisfied with all the answers). Thereafter he instructed the family of his (Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam's) father to carry out the tajheez and takfeen.(Sayyidina 'Ali, Sayyidina Fadl bin 'Abbaas, Sayyidina Usaamah and Sayyidina Shaqraan,-the slave of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam-Radiyallahu 'Anhum carried out the tajheez and takfeen.)(And to safeguard Islaam and keep away differences and controversies, he suggested a person should be chosen, and all matters referred to him. In one narration it is stated that when Sayyidina 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu unsheathed his sword and was saying, "The one who says that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam has passed away, I will cut off his head". Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu cautioned him and delivered a khutbah wherein he recited the aayah of the Qur-aan: "Muhammad is but a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him..." - Surah Aali 'Imraan, 144.Thereafter he said the one who worshipped Muhammad Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam should know that Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam had passed away, the one who worships Allah, let him know that Allah is living and will live for ever. When the people heard Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu delivering the khutbah, they all attentively turned their attention towards the mimbar. In a narration it is stated, that Abubakr Radiyallah 'Anhu said in this khutbah, it is now necessary to choose a person who shall keep up and guard the deen. Every person should give his view.)The Muhaajireen got together and discussed the matter. They said: 'Lets go to our brothers from among the Ansaar and include them in this matter. The Ansaar said: 'we shall have an amir, and the Muhaajireen, shall have an amir (Upon that Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu narrated the saying of Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallhu 'Alayhi Wasallam that the amirs are from the Quraysh) 'Umar ibnul Khattaab Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'Who is that person who in one instance possesses these three virtues Whom Allah Ta'aala has mentioned Qur-aan thus: "...(1) the second of two; when they two were in the cave, (2) when he said unto his comrade: Grieve not. (3) Lo! Allah is with us..." - Surah Taubah40.Also other virtues. These three should also be such that they are of the highest order: (l.) To have unity and a close relationship with Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and have assisted him when he was alone. (2.) Allah Ta'aala addresses him as the Companion of Sayyidina Rasululah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam'. (3) Be in the company of Allah, as Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam has said to him that 'Allah is with us'. At that time both Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam and Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu were there, regarding which Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam said: 'Allah is with us.' Sayyidina'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'You say, who are these two persons that are mentioned in the aayah. How great are these two personalities?' i.e. Who can be a greater personality than Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam and Sayyidina Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu? Besides this they discussed other matters too, which have been mentioned in the narrations. In one hadith it is stated Sayyidina 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: 'O Ansaar, do you know that Rasulullah Sallallahu'Alayhi Wasallam instructed Abubakr to stand on his musallaa (place of prayer)? During the time of his illness he instructed Abubakr to lead the prayers? Who amongst you has the heart to remove such a person from the imaamah, whom Rasululllah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam appointed as an Imaam'. The Ansaar said: 'We seek refuge in Allah. We cannot by pass Abubakr'Thereafter 'Umar Radiyallahu 'Anhu offered him his hand and made bay'ah (allegiance). All the people (present at Saqifah whole heartedly and with eagerness) also made bay'ah on the hands of Abubakr Radiyallahu 'Anhu.</text>

      <text>Yazeed Al Faarisi bin Hurmuz, who was a calligrapher of the Qur-aan, once saw Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam in his dream during the time of Ibn 'Abbaas Radiyallahu 'Anhu. He related his dream to Ibn 'Abbaas. Ibn 'Abbaas said:</text>
      <text>"Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam used to say that the shaytaan cannot imitate him. That person who has seen him in a dream has really seen him'. After mentioning this he asked: 'Can you describe this person whom you have seen in your dream?'. I replied: 'Yes, I can, I will describe to you a man whose body and height were of a medium stature. He had a wheat-coloured complexion with a bit of whiteness in it. Eyes like those that had kuhl on them. A smiling face. Beautiful and round face. A compact beard which surrounded his mubaarak face, and spread on the fore-portion of the chest". 'Awf ibn Abl Jamilah, a narrator of this hadith says: "I do not remember what other feature besides these, my ustaadh Yazeed, who is a narrator of this hadith, described". Ibn 'Abbaas Radiyallahu 'Anhu said: "If you had seen him while being awake, you would not have been able to describe him any further"</text>
